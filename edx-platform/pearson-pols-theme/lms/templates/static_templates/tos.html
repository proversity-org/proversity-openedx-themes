But if we make a change which in our view materially decreases its content or functionality, we will notify you (if you purchased access yourself) or your educational institution/ employer of this. In that case, the educational institution or employer (if they bought access for you) might terminate their subscription agreement with us and you may no longer be able to access the products.
We may replace any product with another product and migrate you to the new product according to the terms we have agreed with you if you purchase directly from us or with your educational institution/ employer if they purchased access.
Pearson reserves the right to vary these Terms of Use at any time and then the varied terms shall apply. If we do this, we will post the changes to these Terms of Use on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date these terms were last revised. We may also email you to let you know that we have updated the Terms of Use.</p>

These Terms of Use, together with the subscription agreement, contain the entire agreement between us regarding the website and all products. Your non-compliance with these Terms of Use may result in our suspension or termination of your access or where an educational institution purchased the access for you, it may result in the suspension or termination of access by your educational institution to the website and any product.

A person who is not party to these Terms of Use shall have no right under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any provision of these Terms of Use. This shall not affect any right or remedy of a third party which exists or is available apart from that Act.
We will not be responsible for any breach of these Terms of Use caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control.
