      <h2>Privacy Notice</h2>
      <p>Updated 20 June 2018</p>
      <br />
      <p>Here, you can find out how we safeguard your information and how we use it to improve our products and services for the benefit of all our customers and website users. </p>
      <p>The nature of our business means that, from time to time, we’ll require some personal details from our customers and website users.</p>
      <p>The data we collect could just be a name and an email address, but depending on your level of engagement with Pearson, it could be much more than that.</p>
      <p>The personal information you’ve shared with us, along with data on how you use our websites - what you search for and what preferences you select, for example - help us to better understand our customers as a group and as individuals. This in turn helps us to provide a range of products and services that meet your needs.</p>

      <h2>How we protect your data</h2>
      <p>When you share your personal information with any company, you have a right to expect that information to be treated with total confidentiality. </p>
      <p>Your privacy is extremely important to us. We’re committed to protecting any personal information you’ve given us, and we comply with all relevant data protection laws.</p>
      <p>This means that:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p><strong>We take full responsibility for the information we hold about you</strong></p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p><strong>We will protect your privacy at all times</strong></p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p><strong>We will never sell your personal information.</strong></p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Whether you’ve supplied your personal details online, by phone or text, by email or in a letter, we will never use them without a lawful reason to do so. We’ll use them for the purposes for which they were initially requested and as fully explained in this Privacy Notice. These explain how your personal data is being managed and safeguarded by us, including:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>what information we collect about you</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>how we collect and use this information</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>how we safeguard the information you’ve provided</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>your rights in relation to the information we hold about you</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>how to report abuse.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>At Pearson, we know that you care how your personal information is used and we appreciate that you trust us to do that carefully and sensibly.</p>
      <p>This Privacy Notice is designed to help you understand how we and other companies in our group collect and use your personal information. We want you to make informed decisions when using our websites and any features on them, including any registration and e-commerce services.</p>

      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>our group companies </p>

      <p>How does Pearson keep my personal information safe? </p>
      <p>We seek to protect the safety of all your personal information by implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures. For example, provided your browser accepts HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) encryption, we seek to protect your payment information against unauthorised access through a secure server. Where we use third parties to process personal information, we require them to ensure the safety of your information.</p>
      <p>Any personal information that you voluntarily post on a public area of our site, such as a bulletin board or discussion forum, or an interactive area requiring registration and/or subscription, may be collected and used by others. Please be careful what personal information you disclose in this way. You understand that we cannot control the actions of other users.</p>
      <br />

      <h2>Will Pearson send my personal information to another country?</h2>
      <p>We may transfer your personal information to other countries around the world, including countries outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA"), which may not have the same data protection laws as those of the country where you access our sites. Where we transfer your personal information to countries outside of the EEA we will take appropriate steps to ensure your personal information is afforded the same level of protection as described in this Privacy Notice. We have entered into an intercompany data processing agreement using the European Commission standard contractual clauses (in the absence of an adequacy decision) for data transfers to our group companies located outside of the EEA. We rely on adequacy decisions or any adequate data transfer mechanisms adopted by the European Commission or a supervisory authority from time to time for transfers to third parties located in countries outside of the UK or the EEA.</p>

      <h2>For how long will Pearson keep my personal information? </h2>
      <p>We will keep your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we are processing your personal information unless the law permits or requires longer. For example, we might need to keep your personal data for quality assurance of the service we have provided, or we might need to keep it to defend future legal claims. <br />
         <br />
      </p>
      <h2>What if I am under 16 years old? </h2>
      <p>If you are under 16, please be sure to read this Privacy Notice with your parent or guardian and ask them questions about anything you don’t understand. </p>
      <br />

      <h2>What rights do I have? </h2>
      <p>In some regions, such as the EEA (European Economic Area), you may have certain rights in relation to your personal information, including the right to: </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>request access to and obtain a copy of your personal information</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>rectification of your personal information if it is no longer accurate or erasure of your personal information if our retention is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>restrict or object to the processing of your personal information in certain circumstances </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>data portability (if applicable). </p>
