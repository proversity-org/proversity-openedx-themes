      <p>Please review our <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1A5VV7zFGh0p1OCzrg1OW6EUVHeSg09EGh4LfQns9FyI"><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></a><strong>,</strong> which also governs your use of the Services, to understand our data collection and use practices. You acknowledge and explicitly consent to the collection and use of your data, including Personal Information (as defined in the Privacy Policy), in accordance with the Privacy Policy. Further, you acknowledge that the Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time for any reason. </p>
      <h2><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Changes to this EULA.</strong></h2>
      <p>Pearson may make changes to this EULA from time to time for any reason. Typically, these changes are made to conform to current practices, comply with changing regulatory requirements, or other similar purposes. If Pearson modifies this EULA in a manner that materially changes the terms or scope of the Services made available to you, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you by either contacting you via email or posting reasonable notice in connection with the Services to alert you to such changes. Your continued use of the Services after reasonable notice of such changes to the EULA has been provided will constitute your consent to the revised EULA terms.

      <h2><strong>3. The Services</strong></h2>
      <p>This website and its related applications and services (collectively the “<strong>Services”</strong>) is owned by Pearson Education, Inc. and/or its affiliated companies (collectively, "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," or “<strong>Pearson”</strong>). The Services may be delivered to you through the Internet via your browser or app (mobile or otherwise) and may include enrollment (“<strong>Enrollment”</strong>) in one or more online courses (“<strong>Course(s)</strong>”) provided through the Services. While your User Account (defined below) for the Services may continue for an indefinite period of time during which you may enroll in other Courses, your access to those specific Courses provided through the Services is provided on a subscription basis for a limited period of time (each a “<strong>Subscription</strong>”). The Services may be provided directly by Pearson or accessed through a third party integration or an integrated third party service provider (“<strong>Third Party Service</strong>”). The Services may link to or provide options to access third party websites or applications.</p>
      <h2><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Authorized Users and User Accounts</strong></h2>
      <p>The Services are available only to individuals, including but not limited to educational institution, administrators and students, who have gained lawful access to the Services directly from Pearson or its Third Party Service provider or through the institution of which such individual is affiliated (“<strong>Authorized User” or “User”</strong>). In order to initiate access to the Services, you must register for a user account (“<strong>User Account”</strong>) by providing your first name, last name, valid email address (and in the case of Enrollments, your institution, educational institution and Course name or code) and designating a secret and unique username and password (“<strong>Account Credentials”</strong>), as well as any additional information that may be required by your institution. In some cases, your User Account may already be established for you by your institution, or by way of direct access from an integrated Third Party Service, such as a learning management system, each of which may have additional terms of use or requirements for account access. Pearson may use your Account Credentials to validate your account prior to providing access to the Services each time you access the Services.</p>
      <p>You may have only one active User Account at any given time. You agree to provide accurate and truthful information when creating a User Account and to promptly update such information should it change.</p>
      <p>You may not self-register for the Services if you are under the age of 13 unless your educational institution has established an account or registered on your behalf. If you are under the age of 18, you may not register or use the Services without first obtaining permission from your parent or guardian. However, if you are under the age of 18 and enrolled at an institution of higher education, you may self-register for the Services. </p>
      <p>The Services are not intended for use by residents of countries in which trade restrictions prohibit the sale of certain U.S. products or services. You understand and acknowledge that the administrators associated with your institution or a Third Party Service may have access to your User Account and may suspend, modify or terminate your account access at any time and for any reason.</p>
      <h2><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Protection of Account Credentials</strong></h2>
      <p>Your User Account is for your personal use only. Unless we provide an approved mechanism for such use, allowing others to access or use the Services through your User Account is strictly prohibited and you are responsible for all uses of the Services associated with your Account Credentials, whether the use is made by you personally or by a third party due to your disclosure of your Account Credentials. </p>
      <p>In order to protect the security of your Account Credentials and the Services, it is important that you maintain the confidentiality of your Account Credentials. You agree not to (1) use Account Credentials other than your own, or (2) to disclose your Account Credentials to any third party or service, other than an authorized Third Party Service. You agree to take reasonable steps to protect the secrecy of your Account Credentials and immediately notify Pearson at <a href="mailto:navigator@pearson.com">navigator@pearson.com</a> of any known or suspected loss, disclosure or theft of your Account Credentials and/or access codes you obtain in connection with the Services.</p>
      <h2><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Ownership of the Services</strong></h2>
      <p>The website, Course materials and other content provided through the Services (collectively, “<strong>Materials”</strong>) and any supporting software, applications and systems (collectively “<strong>Applications”</strong>) are the exclusive property of Pearson Education, Inc., its affiliates, and/or its licensors, and are protected by U.S. and international copyright and other intellectual property laws. All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved. Except as may be set forth in this EULA, the reproduction, redistribution, modification, publication, or adaptation of Materials or Applications, in whole or in part, without the express written consent of Pearson and/or its licensors is strictly prohibited. The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Materials, but please remember that the availability of this functionality does not mean that the above restrictions do not apply.</p>
      <p>Unless otherwise indicated, trademarks, service marks and trade names (collectively “<strong>Marks</strong>”) that appear on the Services are the property of Pearson or its licensors. Any trademarks not owned by Pearson that appear in the Services are the property of their respective owners. You agree not to misuse or disparage any Marks associated with the Services or use the Marks (or any confusingly similar marks) in such a way that would misrepresent the ownership of the Marks or otherwise confuse the public as to the source or origin of any products or services. You should not use any Mark without obtaining the written consent of the Mark owner, using appropriate notice and attribution of the owner's trademark rights, and using the Marks in accordance with applicable usage guidelines as provided by a Mark’s respective owner. Any such permitted use of the Marks by you shall be to the benefit of the respective Mark owner.</p>
      <h2><strong>7.</strong> <strong>Limited License</strong></h2>
      <p>Pearson grants to you a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license to use the Services for their intended purpose and subject to the terms and restrictions set forth in this EULA, the Privacy Policy and any additional terms which may be established by your institution or Third Party Service.</p>
      <p>You may use, display, and, when such functions are available on the Services, reformat, download, and print, Materials obtained through the Services solely for your own personal, non-commercial, and personal educational purposes.</p>
      <p>You are responsible for meeting the then-current hardware, operating system, Internet browser and other technical requirements necessary to properly use and access the Services. All rights not specifically granted herein are reserved by Pearson. You acknowledge that the license granted under this EULA does not provide you with title to or ownership of the Services, or the Materials contained therein, but only a right of limited use subject to the terms and conditions of this EULA.</p>
      <h2><strong>8.</strong> <strong>Permitted Uses of Materials.</strong></h2>
      <p>You may, on an occasional and irregular basis, include insubstantial portions of the Materials in memoranda, reports and presentations, and then only to the extent that such use is for educational purposes of a non-commercial nature within the scope of, or permissible as "fair use", "fair dealing" or its equivalent under applicable copyright and intellectual property law, provided such use does not otherwise diminish the pedagogical or commercial value of the Materials or the Services and is otherwise accompanied by appropriate copyright notices. If you wish to request permission to reproduce the Materials, or if you have any questions about how to include any notices required under this Section, please refer to the information and contacts available at www.pearsoned.com/permissions.</p>
      <p>Please note that additional permissions may also be required from Pearson's licensors. Your use of any Materials, whether under "fair use" or by permission, must include all applicable copyright, trademark and other notices, and appropriate source attribution to Pearson and its licensors.</p>
      <p>Before using any Materials designated as "open", OER, or available for public use, you should verify the governing licensing restrictions associated with such Materials. No right to use “open,” “OER,” or “available for public use” content is granted by Pearson outside of the Services.</p>
      <h2><strong>9.</strong> <strong>Prohibited Uses of Materials</strong></h2>
      <p>Except as you may be expressly permitted by this EULA, you may not use, modify, adapt, reformat, download, upload, post, reproduce, broadcast, publish, display, perform, transfer or redistribute any Materials in any form, format or media or by means without obtaining the prior written authorization of Pearson and/or its licensors. You acknowledge that the dissemination of any assessment questions or answers contained in the Materials will materially diminish the value of the Services and is strictly forbidden. Without limiting this restriction, you acknowledge that the following “<strong>Prohibited Uses</strong>” shall not constitute "fair use" and are specifically prohibited under the terms of this EULA in the absence of written permission and that any such Prohibited Use constitutes a material breach of the terms of this EULA:</p>
      <ul>

         <li>making the Materials available, by any means, to others (even members of your institution) who are not Authorized Users and/or in connection with courses or other activities for which the Services are not authorized for use;</li>
         <li>publishing or otherwise disseminating outside of the Services solutions to questions or other assessment content contained in the Materials (whether generated by you, Pearson or a third party);</li>
         <li>reproducing or distributing outside the Services, by any means, any illustrations, charts, photographs, outlines, extensive text excerpts, chapters, or e-books included in the Materials for use outside of the relevant Services.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><strong>10.</strong> <strong>Appropriate Use of the Services</strong></h2>
      <p>You are expressly prohibited from any conduct which: threatens the security, integrity or availability of the Services; provides or facilitates access to the Services by unauthorized users or services; and/or results in prohibited duplication, transmission or exposure of the Materials, Applications or User information associated with the Services. You represent and agree that you shall not use the Services in violation of this EULA, any applicable local, state, national or international law or regulation, and/or the academic rules or policies of your institution. You further agree that you will not use the Services in a manner which threatens the security, stability or integrity of the Services or networks connected to the Services (“<strong>Service Network”</strong>). Without limiting the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that that you will not take any action to:</p>
      <ul>

         <li>take or attempt any action that, in the sole and absolute discretion of Pearson, imposes or may impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load or burden on the Service Network, disrupts the normal flow of data, or threatens the stability of the Services or Service Network; or</li>
         <li>engage any conduct which, in Pearson's sole and absolute discretion, diminishes the pedagogical or commercial value of the Services, infringes any proprietary rights in the Materials or Applications, or otherwise violates this EULA.</li>

      <p>Pearson reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to suspend or terminate access to and use the Services with respect to any User that Pearson reasonably believes has undertaken, or participated in, any of the foregoing activities, violated the terms of this EULA, or whose actions have, or are likely to, otherwise cause harm to Pearson, the Services, the Service Network or other Users, or for any other reason at the sole and absolute discretion of Pearson. Additionally, Pearson may suspend or terminate your access at any time at the request of your institution.</p>
      <h2><strong>11. Permissible User Content</strong></h2>
      <p>The Services may provide functionalities for Authorized Users to create, upload or post questions, responses, comments, ideas, articles, information, data, text, multimedia content, chat conversations or logs, messages and other materials or submissions (“<strong>User Content”</strong>). You may only post User Content that is your own original work or for which you have obtained the necessary rights or permissions for reproduction and public display through the Services and include any applicable ownership or attribution notices. (<em>Note: The fact that content is publicly available on the Internet does not mean that such content may be freely used without seeking prior permission from the owner.</em>) You are solely responsible for User Content that you post on the Services and agree not to create, post, upload or link to any Prohibited User Content (as defined below). Pearson does not pre-screen User Content and assumes no responsibility for User Content. The views and opinions expressed in any User Content do not necessarily reflect those of Pearson or its licensors. Pearson has the right (but not the obligation), in its sole discretion, to monitor, refuse to post or otherwise distribute, or remove any User Content for any reason and to terminate your access to the Services to prevent further posting or distribution of Prohibited User Content. If you discover any Prohibited User Content and would like to inform us, please contact us at <a href="mailto:dmca.agent@pearsoned.com">dmca.agent@pearsoned.com</a>.</p>
      <h2><strong>12.</strong> <strong>Use of User Content</strong></h2>
      <p>By creating, posting, uploading or linking to User Content, you grant to Pearson a perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide right and license to use, host, license, store, reproduce, transmit, adapt, and distribute such User Content and any derivative works created from such User Content (such as those resulting from changes we make so that your User Content works better with the Services) in connection with the Services. Further, you acknowledge and agree that your User Content shall be available to other Users on the same terms as granted by you to Pearson under this EULA and specifically this Section 12. Pearson shall not be responsible or liable for the deletion, destruction, damage, loss or failure to store any User Content. By posting User Content that is owned by third parties, you represent that you have been granted the right to grant to Pearson the right to make such User Content available to Authorized Users to the same extent as the Materials provided with the Services. You agree to provide proper copyright notices in connection with any User Content in which you or a third party assert a right of copyright. Additional terms and options may be presented through the user interface available on the Services for posting or uploading User Content which shall have the same force and effect as the terms of this EULA.</p>
      <p>Please note that this section 12 may not apply to some users accessing the Services from within jurisdictions that prohibit such use of User Content.</p>
      <h2>13. Prohibited User Content.</h2>
      </ol>
      <p>You will, at all times comply with all applicable local, state, provincial, national, and foreign laws in using the Services. You agree that you will not (directly or through others) contribute, create, upload, post, link to, or otherwise cause the distribution of any content or use the Services in any manner that:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, indecent, offensive, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable or in violation of the rules or policies of the institution;</li>

      </ul>
      <h2>14. User Suggestions</h2>
      </ol>
      <p>Pearson always welcomes suggestions and comments regarding the Services. Suggested improvements, additions or other comments may be submitted by you to Pearson, whether through the Services, online, offline, verbally, or in writing (“<strong>User Suggestions”</strong>) Regardless of the manner of submission, you hereby acknowledge that all right, title and interest and any other intellectual property rights in the User Suggestions shall become the exclusive property of Pearson and may be used for its business purposes at Pearson’s sole and absolute discretion without any payment or accounting to you. This policy is intended to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when products and services developed by Pearson might seem to others to be similar to their own submissions or comments. No reference to your personal information shall be made in connection with the any use by Pearson of User Suggestions.</p>
      <h2> 16. No Liability for Third Party Websites and Third Party Content</h2>
      <p>Pearson assumes no responsibility for third party content (“<strong>Third Party Content</strong>”), services or applications that may be accessed by way of links on the Services to sites hosted by third parties that are outside of Pearson's control (“<strong>Third-Party Sites”</strong>). Pearson does not endorse or guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of Third Party Site or Third Party Content and disclaims all liability for any errors, omissions, violation of third-party rights or illegal conduct arising from such content or sites. The inclusion of a link to any Third Party Site in the Services does not imply that the owners of such Third-Party Sites have sponsored or endorsed the Services. Pearson is not responsible for the accessibility of Third-Party Sites accessed through links to the Services. Should you discover that a link to a Third-Party Site is no longer functional please contact us at: <a href="mailto:navigator@pearson.com">navigator@pearson.com</a>. Any links which directs Users to inappropriate content or Prohibited User Content should be reported to us at <a href="mailto:dmca.agent@pearsoned.com">dmca.agent@pearsoned.com</a>.</p>
      <h2>17. Availability of the Service</h2>
      <p>The scope and availability of the Services may vary according to (1) additional terms presented at the time of purchase or registration, (2) Enrollment in or registration for a specific Course or Service, and/or (3) any licensing terms between Pearson and your institution. Pearson is not responsible for limitations of access resulting from any Third Party Service or as the result of certain account settings established by your institution. You are responsible for obtaining Internet access in order to use the Services. You may access a Course available through the Services only for the duration of the Subscription purchased (typically one or two semesters depending on the Course), whether or not the Services are used and subject to Pearson's right to terminate access under this EULA. Educational institution access may be provided for an indefinite time period until otherwise terminated subject to this EULA.</p>
      <p>While Pearson makes reasonable efforts to ensure the availability of the Services to Authorized Users with active Subscriptions, the Services may be unavailable for limited periods of time due to scheduled routine maintenance, emergency maintenance or factors beyond Pearson's control, such as disruptions of internet services or unforeseen threats to the integrity or security of the Services.</p>
      <p>Pearson may at any time, with or without notice to you, restrict the use and accessibility of the Services and/or discontinue any portion, feature, or content of the Services. Pearson will make reasonable efforts to provide Authorized Users notice of significant changes to the Services to Authorized Users with active Subscriptions whenever reasonably feasible and provide alternative materials or services if substantial portions of the Services become unavailable. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:navigator@pearson.com">navigator@pearson.com</a> to request information and updates about changes to the Services and its availability.</p>

      <h2>18. Termination of Access</h2>
      <ol>
         <li><strong>a)</strong> <strong>Trial Access.</strong> On a case-by-case basis, Services may be made available to you for a trial review period for up to fifteen (15) days (“<strong>Review Period</strong>”). During the Review Period, you will be provided access to the Services without charge; however, access to the Services offered for trial review will be terminated if payment is not made prior to the end of the Review Period. Termination of a Service does not automatically terminate your User Account. Further, you expressly acknowledge and agree that if at any time during the Review Period, Pearson, in its sole discretion, determines that you are utilizing the Review Period as a substitute or proxy for a paid Service, it may immediately terminate or suspend your access to the applicable Service for which you’ve been granted a Review Period. In the event of any suspension or termination of your access to such a Service, you acknowledge and agree that: (a) the Service, its functionality, activities, materials, or any results generated by your use thereof may not be available to you or any other person; and (b) neither you nor any other person are authorized to access or use any results generated by your use of the suspended or terminated Course, its functionality, activities, or materials regardless of whether such results are available within the Course or the Services. If your access to a Course is terminated due to you not purchasing a Course Subscription, and then Pearson subsequently reinstates your access to the Course upon later receiving payment, any such reinstated access shall remain subject to the terms of this EULA (unless Pearson provides new terms and conditions to You at the time of such reinstated access, in which case such new terms and conditions shall apply).</li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
         <li><strong>b)</strong> <strong>Termination by You.</strong> Subject to account restrictions that may be imposed by Pearson, your institution or a Third Party Service through which access to the Services is provided, you may terminate your User Account at any time by notifying Pearson of your decision to do so. Your satisfaction with the Services is important to us. If you have any concerns or complaints about the Services or wish to terminate your access to the Services, please contact us at <a href="mailto:navigator@pearson.com">navigator@pearson.com</a>.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
         <li><strong>c)</strong> <strong>Termination by Pearson. </strong>Pearson may, in its sole discretion, and with or without advance notice, suspend your access to all or any part of the Services, or terminate your rights to use the Services, for any conduct or use (whether by you or anyone else having access to the Services under your Account Credentials) that Pearson reasonably believes violates this EULA.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
      <li><strong>d)</strong> <strong>Effect of Termination</strong>. Whether termination is initiated by you, your institution or Pearson, Sections 12, 14, 17-21, and 25 of this EULA shall survive any such termination. Any User Account information, data, settings or specifications or customizations of a Service or Subscription specific to your User Account may be permanently lost upon termination of a Service or Subscription provided through the Services, whether by you, Pearson or your institution. User Content and other user information associated with your use of the Services may still be accessible by your institution or, to the extent it is posted in a public forum, to other Users of the Services for which such information was posted, even after termination.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>19. Sole Remedy</h2>
      <p>Pearson's entire liability to you, and your sole and exclusive remedy, regarding the use of the Services shall be either restoration of access for which you have subscribed or purchased, or a refund of any fees paid directly by you to Pearson for the particular Service or Subscription. When available, refunds will only be made if requested by you in writing within the first 15 days after Enrollment or registration. Refunds can only be provided for purchases made directly from Pearson's website by an Authorized User. Refunds are not available for lost or stolen access codes, or any purchases made through third parties (for example, your campus bookstore). If you are dissatisfied with a Service or wish to request a refund, please contact us at <a href="mailto:navigator@pearson.com">navigator@pearson.com</a>.</p>
